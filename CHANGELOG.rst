  training data. all examples should go into the ``common_examples`` section
- weight training samples based on class distribution during ner_crf
  cross validation and sklearn intent classification training

    to ``{"extractor": "ner_mitie", "processors": ["ner_synonyms"], "start": 15, "end": 28, "value": "New York City", "entity": "GPE"}``

    where ``extractor`` denotes the entity extractor that originally found an entity, and ``processor`` denotes components that alter entities, such as the synonym component.
- camel cased MITIE classes (e.g. ``MITIETokenizer`` → ``MitieTokenizer``)
- model metadata changed, see migration guide
- updated to spacy 1.7 and dropped training and loading capabilities for
  the spacy component (breaks existing spacy models!)
