Tutorial: A simple restaurant search bot
========================================

.. note::

    See :ref:`section_migration` for how to clone your
    existing wit/LUIS/Dialogflow app.

As an example we'll start a new project covering the domain
of searching for restaurants. We'll start with an extremely simple
model of those conversations. You can build up from there.

Let's assume that `anything` our bot's users say can be
categorized into one of the following **intents**:

- ``greet``
- ``restaurant_search``
- ``thankyou``

Of course there are many ways our users might ``greet`` our bot: 

- `Hi!`
- `Hey there!`
- `Hello again :)`

And even more ways to say that you want to look for restaurants:

- `Do you know any good pizza places?`
- `I'm in the North of town and I want chinese food`
- `I'm hungry`

The first job of Rasa NLU is to assign any given sentence to one of
the **intent** categories: ``greet``, ``restaurant_search``, or ``thankyou``.

The second job is to label words like "Mexican" and "center" as
``cuisine`` and ``location`` **entities**, respectively.
In this tutorial we'll build a model which does exactly that.

Preparing the Training Data
---------------------------

The training data is essential to develop chatbots. It should include
texts to be interpreted and the structured data (intent/entities) we expect
chatbots to convert the texts into. The best way to get training texts is
from *real users*, and the best way to get the structured data is to
`pretend to be the bot yourself <https://medium.com/rasa-blog/put-on-your-robot-costume-and-be-the-minimum-viable-bot-yourself-3e48a5a59308>`_.
But to help get you started, we have some
`data saved <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/blob/master/data/examples/rasa/demo-rasa.json>`_.

Download the file (json format) and open it, and you'll see a list of
training examples, each composed of ``"text"``, ``"intent"`` and
``"entities"``, as shown below. In your working directory, create a
``data`` folder, and copy this ``demo-rasa.json`` file there.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "text": "hey", 
      "intent": "greet", 
      "entities": []
    }

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "text": "show me chinese restaurants", 
      "intent": "restaurant_search", 
      "entities": [
        {
          "start": 8, 
          "end": 15, 
          "value": "chinese", 
          "entity": "cuisine",
          "confidence": 0.875
        }
      ]
    }

Hopefully the format is intuitive if you've read this far into the
tutorial, for details see :ref:`section_dataformat`. Otherwise,
the next section 'visualizing the training data' can help you
better read, verify and/or modify the training data.

.. _visualizing-the-training-data:

Visualizing the Training Data
-----------------------------

It's always a good idea to `look` at your data before, during,
and after training a model. Luckily, there's a
`great tool <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-nlu-trainer>`__
for creating training data in rasa's format.
- created by `@azazdeaz <https://github.com/azazdeaz>`_ -
and it's also extremely helpful for inspecting and modifying existing data.


For the demo data the output should look like this:

.. image:: _static/images/rasa_nlu_intent_gui.png


It is **strongly** recommended that you view your training
data in the GUI before training.

.. _training_your_model:

Training a New Model for your Project
-------------------------------------

Now we're going to create a configuration file. Make sure first that
you've set up a backend, see :ref:`section_backends`. Create a file
called ``config_spacy.yml`` in your working directory which looks like this
 
.. literalinclude:: ../sample_configs/config_spacy.yml
    :language: yaml

or if you've installed the MITIE backend, you can use the following as your
base configuration:


.. literalinclude:: ../sample_configs/config_mitie.yml
    :language: yaml

Now we can train a spacy model by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m rasa_nlu.train \
        --config sample_configs/config_spacy.yml \
        --data data/examples/rasa/demo-rasa.json \
        --path projects

What do these parameters mean?

- **config**: configuration of the machine learning model
- **data**: file or folder that contains the training data. You can also
pull training data from a URL using ``--url`` instead.
- **path**: output path where the model is persisted to


If you want to know more about the parameters, there is an overview of the
:ref:`section_configuration`. After a few minutes, Rasa NLU will finish
training, and you'll see a new folder named as
``projects/default/model_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`` with the timestamp
when training finished.

.. _tutorial_using_your_model:

Using Your Model
----------------

By default, the server will look for all projects folders under the ``path``
directory specified. When no project is specified, as in this example,
a "default" one will be used, itself using the latest trained model.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m rasa_nlu.server --path projects

More information about starting the server can be found in :ref:`section_http`.

You can then test your new model by sending a request. Open a new window
on your terminal and run

.. note::

    **For windows users** the windows command line interface doesn't
    like single quotes. Use doublequotes and escape where necessary.
    ``curl -X POST "localhost:5000/parse" -d "{/"q/":/"I am looking for Mexican food/"}" | python -m json.tool``

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -X POST localhost:5000/parse -d '{"q":"I am looking for Mexican food"}' | python -m json.tool

which should return 

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "intent": {
        "name": "restaurant_search",
        "confidence": 0.8231117999072759
        },
        "entities": [
            {
                "start": 17,
                "end": 24,
                "value": "mexican",
                "entity": "cuisine",
                "extractor": "ner_crf",
                "confidence": 0.875
            }
        ],
        "intent_ranking": [
            {
                "name": "restaurant_search",
                "confidence": 0.8231117999072759
            },
            {
                "name": "affirm",
                "confidence": 0.07618757211779097
            },
            {
                "name": "goodbye",
                "confidence": 0.06298664363805719
            },
            {
                "name": "greet",
                "confidence": 0.03771398433687609
            }
        ],
        "text": "I am looking for Mexican food"
    }

If you are using the ``spacy_sklearn`` backend and the entities aren't
found, don't panic! This tutorial is just a toy example, with far too
little training data to expect good performance.

.. note::

    Intent classification is independent of entity extraction, e.g.
    in "I am looking for Chinese food" the entities are not extracted,
    though intent classification is correct.

Rasa NLU will also print a ``confidence`` value for the intent
classification. For models using spacy
intent classification this will be a probability.

You can use this to do some error handling in your chatbot (ex:
asking the user again if the confidence is low) and it's also
helpful for prioritising which intents need more training data.

.. note::
    The output may contain other or less attributes, depending on the
    pipeline you are using. For example, the ``mitie`` pipeline doesn't
    include the ``"intent_ranking"`` (see example below) whereas the
    ``spacy_sklearn`` pipeline does (see example above).


With very little data, rasa NLU can in certain cases
already generalise concepts, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -X POST localhost:5000/parse -d '{"q":"I want some italian food"}' | python -m json.tool
    {
        "intent": {
            "name": "restaurant_search",
            "confidence": 0.5792111723774511
        },
        "entities": [
            {
                "entity": "cuisine",
                "value": "italian",
                "start": 12,
                "end": 19,
                "extractor": "ner_crf",
                "confidence": 0.875
            }
        ],
        "text": "I want some italian food"
    }

even though there's nothing quite like this sentence in
the examples used to train the model. To build a more robust app
you will obviously want to use a lot more training data, so go and collect it!
