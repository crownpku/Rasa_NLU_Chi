Improving your models from feedback
===================================

When the rasa_nlu server is running, it keeps track of all the
predictions it's made and saves these to a log file.
By default log files are placed in ``logs/``. The files in this
directory contain one json object per line.
You can fix any incorrect predictions and add them to your
training set to improve your parser.
After adding these to your training data, but before
retraining your model, it is strongly recommended that you use the
visualizer to spot any errors, see
:ref:`Visualizing training data <visualizing-the-training-data>`.
